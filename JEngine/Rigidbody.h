---------------------Rigidbody.h-----------------------

	Purpose -
		To provide a container for physics data 
		to be used in translation and rotation.



	Functionality -
		Capable of the following,


		* Addition of force to be used in translation

			(void addForce(const Vector2&))

		* Addition of torque to be used in rotation

			(void addTorque(const float&)

		* Integrate force/torque into current acceleration

			(void integrate(Transform*, float [deltaTime]))
