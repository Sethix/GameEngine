-----------------------Vector3.h-----------------------

	Purpose -
		Contains three floating point values.



	Functionality -
		Capable of the following,


		* Addition between vectors

			(+, +=)

		* Subtraction between vectors

			(-, -=)

		* Multiplication between vectors

			(*, *=)

		* Division between vectors

			(/, /=)

		* Imperfect equality comparison between vectors

			(==, !=, >, >=, <, <=)

		* Calculate the dot product of two vectors

			(float dot(Vector3, Vector3))

		* Calculate the length of a vector

			(float mag(Vector3))

		* Calculate the cross product between vectors

			(Vector3 cross(Vector3, Vector3)

		* Calculate the normal of a vector

			(Vector3 normal(Vector3))

		* Set the a vector to it's normal

			(Vector3 normalize())

		* Interpolate between two vectors using a value from 0-1

			(Vector3 lerp(Vector3(0), Vector3(1), float))

		* Clamp a vector inside a minimum and maximum point

			(Vector3 clamp(Vector3(A), Vector3(MIN), Vector3(MAX));

		* Grab the minimum values from an array of vectors

			(Vector3 min(Vector3*, size_t))

		* Grab the maximum values from an array of vectors

			(Vector3 max(Vector3*, size_t))

		* Calculate physcal reflection off of a normalized surface

			(Vector3 reflect(Vector3 incident, Vector3 normal))

		* Run test cases to make sure all functions work

			(void DebugV3())
