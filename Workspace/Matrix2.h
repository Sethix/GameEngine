-----------------------Matrix2.h-----------------------

	Purpose -
		Contains an array of numbers in a 2X2 grid.



	Functionality -
		Capable of the following,


		* Addition between matrices			
			
			(+, +=)

		* Subtraction between matrices		
		
			(-, -=)

		* Multiplication between matrices	
		
			(*, *=)

		* Multiplication between matrix and vector 2

			(*, *=)

		* Imperfect equality comparison between matrices

			(==)

		* Calculate the determinant of a matrix 2

			(float determinant(Matrix2))

		* Calculate the inverse of a matrix 2

			(Matrix2 inverse(Matrix2))

		* Transpose matrix 2 to diagonally flip the values

			(Matrix2 transpose(Matrix2))

		* Run test cases to make sure all functions work

			(void DebugM2())
