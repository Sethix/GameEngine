-----------------------Matrix4.h-----------------------

	Purpose -
		Contains an array of numbers in a 4X4 grid.



	Functionality -
		Capable of the following,


		* Addition between matrices

			(+, +=)

		* Subtraction between matrices

			(-, -=)

		* Multiplication between matrices

			(*, *=)

		* Multiplication between matrix and vector 4

			(*, *=)

		* Imperfect equality comparison between matrices

			(==)

		* Calculate the determinant of a matrix 4

			(float determinant(Matrix4))

		* Calculate the inverse of a matrix 4

			(Matrix4 inverse(Matrix4))

		* Transpose matrix 4 to diagonally flip the values

			(Matrix4 transpose(Matrix4))

		* Run test cases to make sure all functions work

			(void DebugM4())
